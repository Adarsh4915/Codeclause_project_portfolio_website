    Introduction</h1>
    <br>


     I am a second-year student at  NMIT, pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 
     I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and society and how computer 
     science can be leveraged to solve real-world problems.
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>

    
    During my academic journey, I have gained expertise in several areas of computer science, including
    programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, data structures and algorithms, computer networks,
    and web development. I have completed several projects that have allowed me to apply these concepts in 
    real-world settings, such as developing a chat application, building a web-based e-commerce platform, 
    and implementing a neural network for image classification.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>


    In addition to my academic pursuits, I have been actively involved in extracurricular activities, 
    such as hackathons, coding competitions, and technology conferences. These experiences have helped 
    me to develop my teamwork, leadership, and communication skills, and provided me with a platform to
     learn and experiment with new technologies.
     <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    I am also a part of a student-run organization on campus that aims to promote technology literacy among
     underprivileged students. As a volunteer, I have designed and delivered workshops on programming basics,
      web development, and digital literacy to school students.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    I am excited to share my CSE portfolio with you, which showcases my programming skills, projects, and
     community involvement. I am eager to learn and grow in the technology industry, and I believe my skills,
      enthusiasm, and commitment to excellence will enable me to be a valuable member of any team.
